# Chaos Game - Numberphile
This program is a recreation and a expansion of what was shown in Numberphile's [**Chaos Game - Numberphile**](https://youtu.be/kbKtFN71Lfs). It starts by creating a polygon of the desired size. Then it creates a point on top of the first corner. After that, in each iteration the dot moves towards a randomly chosen corner by the distance between them divided by the "divisor". These random sets of moves creates really interesting patterns as shown in the video.

**Controls:**
- *Vertical Arrows*: Change corner count of the polygon
- *Horizontal Arrows*: Change the "divisor".

## Here are Some Examples:

### Triangle with a divisor of 2, forming a *"Sierpi≈Ñski triangle"*

### Hexagon with a divisor of 3.
